# Changelog

## v4.1.0

### Added

-   **Type-Safe Stream Query Post-Handler:** Introduced the new `IStreamQueryPostHandler<TQuery, TQueryResult>` interface. This provides a strongly-typed post-handler for stream queries, giving access to the original query and the `IAsyncEnumerable<TQueryResult>` result stream, aligning its design with regular command and query post-handlers.

### Fixed

-   **Stream Query Context Preservation:** Fixed a critical bug in the stream query mediation strategy where the `AmbientExecutionContext` was lost during stream enumeration. This prevented stream handlers from accessing the context (e.g., `Items` collection) in logic that executed after yielding all results, and also prevented stream post-handlers from accessing the context. The context is now correctly preserved throughout the entire streaming lifecycle.

## v4.0.0

This is a major release with a fundamental architectural redesign to decouple the library from specific Dependency Injection (DI) containers, introduce a durable Command Inbox, and provide advanced control over event mediation.

### ðŸš€ Features

-   **Dependency Injection Abstraction (`LiteBus.Runtime`):** The entire library has been refactored to be DI-agnostic, introducing a new runtime layer. This decouples the core logic from any specific DI container and allows for integrations via a lightweight adapter pattern.
-   **Autofac Support:** Added first-class integration with Autofac via the new `LiteBus.Extensions.Autofac` package and its companions.
-   **Durable Command Inbox:** Introduced a new Command Inbox feature for guaranteed, durable, and deferred command execution. Commands can be marked with `[StoreInInbox]` to be persisted and processed by a background service (`CommandInboxProcessorHostedService`).
-   **Advanced Event Mediation:** Overhauled event mediation with powerful new controls:
  -   The new `[HandlerPriority]` attribute replaces `[HandlerOrder]` for defining execution priority.
  -   Added configurable concurrency for both priority groups (`PriorityGroupsConcurrencyMode`) and handlers within the same group (`HandlersWithinSamePriorityConcurrencyMode`).
  -   Enhanced `HandlerPredicate` that receives a full `IHandlerDescriptor` for advanced filtering logic based on handler type, priority, tags, and message type.

### âœ¨ Improvements

-   **Simplified Module Registration:** The `AddCommandModule`, `AddEventModule`, and `AddQueryModule` extensions now automatically register the core `MessageModule`, reducing boilerplate configuration.
-   **Robust Message Registry:** The internal `MessageRegistry` has been re-engineered for improved performance and correctness, ensuring handlers are correctly associated with messages regardless of registration order.
-   **API Clarity:** Renamed several properties for better intent, such as `Order` to `Priority` on descriptors and `Handlers` to `MainHandlers` on `IMessageDependencies`.
-   **Testability:** Added `IMessageRegistry.Clear()` to allow resetting the registry state, which is useful in test environments.

### ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

-   **Project Structure & NuGet Packages:** The project structure and package names have been completely refactored. You must update your `.csproj` files to reference the new packages (e.g., `LiteBus.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`, `LiteBus.Commands.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`).
-   **DI Registration API:** The `AddLiteBus` registration process is now part of the new DI-specific extension packages. Module registration extensions (`AddCommandModule`, etc.) have moved to their respective core namespaces (e.g., `LiteBus.Commands`).
-   **Attribute Renaming:** `[HandlerOrder]` has been replaced by `[HandlerPriority]`. The `Order` property on `IHandlerDescriptor` is now `Priority`.
-   **Mediation Settings `Items` Key:** The key type for the `Items` dictionary on `CommandMediationSettings`, `QueryMediationSettings`, and `ExecutionContext` has been changed from `object` to `string`.
-   **`EventMediationSettings` Redesign:** The structure of `EventMediationSettings` has been completely changed to support the new priority and concurrency features. The `Filters` property is now `Routing`, and a new `Execution` property has been added.
-   **`IMessageDependencies` Renaming:** The `Handlers` and `IndirectHandlers` properties have been renamed to `MainHandlers` and `IndirectMainHandlers`, respectively. This affects custom mediation strategies.

> **Note:** Due to the significant architectural changes, please refer to the **v4 Migration Guide** in the release notes for detailed instructions on upgrading your project.


## v3.1.0

- **Added**: Support for passing contextual metadata through the mediation pipeline. The `CommandMediationSettings`,
  `QueryMediationSettings`, and `EventMediationSettings` now include an `Items` dictionary (
  `IDictionary<object, object?>`) that can be used to pass data to all handlers (pre-handlers, main handlers,
  post-handlers, and error-handlers) via `AmbientExecutionContext.Current.Items`.

## v3.0.0

- **Breaking Change**: All LiteBus assemblies are now strong-named to support usage in enterprise applications and
  projects that require signed dependencies. This is a breaking change that requires a major version update.

## v2.2.3

- **Fixed**: Remove extra DI container registration

## v2.2.2

- **Fixed**: DI container registration now properly filters out interfaces and abstract classes during service
  registration. Previously, `RegisterFromAssembly()` would cause DI container errors when trying to register
  non-instantiable types. LiteBus message registry continues to accept all types to support polymorphic dispatch, but
  only concrete classes are registered with the DI container.

## v2.2.1

- **Fixed**: Support for record structs as message types (commands, queries, events). Previously record structs couldn't
  be registered due to a type filtering condition that only allowed class types.
- **Improved**: Message registration to handle all non-System types, allowing for greater flexibility in message
  definitions.

## v2.2.0

- **Added**: Support for incremental registration allowing for breaking down LiteBus configuration in different parts of
  the application.

## v2.1.0

- **Added**: .NET 9 support while maintaining backward compatibility with .NET 8
- **Updated**: All dependencies to their latest .NET 9 compatible versions
- **Improved**: Multi-targeting build process for both .NET 8 and .NET 9

## v2.0.0

- **Breaking Change**: Removed nullable annotations from mediator interfaces. Nullability should now be expressed in
  message contracts instead. See [Migration Guide](https://github.com/litenova/LiteBus/wiki/Migration-Guide) for
  details.
