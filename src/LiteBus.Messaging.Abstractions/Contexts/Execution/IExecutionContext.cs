///     Represents the execution context for a specific operation or task.

/// <remarks>
///     The execution context provides access to information and services that are relevant to the current
///     execution, such as cancellation tokens, shared data, and tags for filtering handlers.
///     It also provides a mechanism for aborting the execution and setting a result.
///     The execution context is typically created at the beginning of a mediation operation and is
///     available throughout the entire mediation pipeline, including pre-handlers, main handlers,
///     post-handlers, and error handlers.
